## Lyrics

```
what's in the moment you don't recognize
forgotten times made you alive again
trade of the demons made you feeble friend

here's a demon's ode to my dead friends
you'll be remembered through all time and we'll shine again
in the hive we will brace, sleep will not contain our
mechanoreceptors bursting flames

might as well close your eyes 
let them in let them in let them in
take the ties before the cut off

even though you stopped with the highs

you are down so low

and i keep reeling in the saymon 
fierce

```
