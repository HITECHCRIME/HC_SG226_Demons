## Lyrics

```
what's in the moment you don't recognize
forgotten times made you alive again
trade of the demons made you feeble friend
might as well close your eyes 
let them in let them in let them in
take the ties before the cut off

even though you stopped with the highs

you are down so low

and i keep reeling in the saymon 
fierce

```
